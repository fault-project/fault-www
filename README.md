fault is a Rust-powered CLI with two main features:

* fault injection: injects network faults into your system to learn about their impacts and how you recover from failures.
* AI-agent: run fault as a MCP server in your favourit code editor to improve the production-soundness of its output

## Build

Install the dependencies using [pdm](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/):

```bash
pdm install
```

Then you can serve locally the documentation:

```bash
