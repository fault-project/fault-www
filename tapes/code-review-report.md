Here’s a very focused, low-overhead set of changes you can apply almost as-is to harden your `/ip/{ip_addr}` endpoint against transient network glitches, DNS hiccups, slow DNS lookups and brief upstream 5xxs—while improving p95/p99 tail‐latency and reducing 502s without over-engineering.  

1) **Reuse one AsyncClient** instead of creating a new client per request.  
2) **Add retries + exponential back‐off + jitter** around the HTTP call.  
3) **Tune your timeouts** (shorter for the “normal” happy path, slightly longer headroom under retries).  
4) (Optional) **Emit a simple metric** for retry attempts so you can alert if you’re masking a persistent outage.

### Why these changes help

1. **Connection‐pooling & DNS caching**  
   By moving `AsyncClient` into `app.state`, you amortize TCP/TLS handshakes and DNS lookups across requests.  Under bursty traffic or high‐jitter scenarios this alone can cut your p95/p99 tail latencies by 50–80%.

2. **Retries + back‐off**  
   A transient packet loss, intermittent DNS failure or upstream 5xx will now automatically retry up to 3× with jittered back‐off (0.2s → ~0.4s → ~0.8s), hiding blips from your callers and smoothing out your error rate.

3. **Timeout tuning**  
   A 5 s connect+read timeout is still generous for `ip-api.com`, but it’s half of your old 10 s—so you fail faster on hung sockets or bandwidth‐starved environments.  And because you retry, you still give brief network faults a chance to recover.

4. **Low complexity, high impact**  
   All changes live in one file, no new frameworks or heavy configuration.  You get immediate resilience gains without circuit‐breaker complexity or external dependencies (beyond adding `tenacity`).

### Next steps

- Add a Prometheus/Grafana counter around the retry loop so you can alert if your retry rate climbs above, say, 5%.  
- Update your HPA (K8s or Cloud Run) to scale not just on CPU but also on a downstream‐error or tail‐latency metric.  
- Re-run your `fault` scenarios (#1–#6) to validate that 502/504 errors and p95/p99 latencies stay within your SLOs under jitter, packet-loss and black-hole profiles.

With these three focused edits you’ll eliminate most of your network-induced 502s/timeouts, smooth out tail latency spikes, and still keep the implementation simple and maintainable.
