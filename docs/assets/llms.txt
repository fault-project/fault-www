# fault

> fault is an Open-Source Rust-powered CLI and AI-MCP server that lets engineers and AI agents team up to ship production-ready code. 

* Homepage: https://fault-project.com/
* Repository: https://github.com/fault-project/fault-cli

## Why?

* Build Like You Have a Full Team: Get AI-powered review hints on reliability, performance and best practices.
* Ground Your Deliveries: Automate SLO-validated scenarios with zero config - preview your feature under fault in seconds.
* Replay Incidents with Ease: Swiftly understand how your application reacts by exploring production flakiness locally.

### Reliability Engineering for Developers

Explore availability threats right from the start through our builtin fault injection engine. Automate continuous validation and make sure you respect your SLOs.

**Examples**

Scramble a LLM prompt by injecting a system prompt:
```bash
fault run llm openai --case prompt-scramble --instruction "Respond as a pirate. Arr"
```

Introduce latency to all calls made through the fault proxy to any hosts:
```bash
fault run --with-latency --latency-mean 300 --upstream '*'
```

Generate a test scenario for a given, OpenAPI specification:
```bash
fault scenario generate --scenario scenario.yaml --spec-url http://example.com/openapi.json
```

Run a scenario:
```bash
fault scenario run --scenario scenario.yaml
```

### AI-Agent Operational Engineering

Bring a touch of operations into your favourite AI-editor with fault builtin MCP server. Ensure you deliver production-aware code and reduce your AI-Agent delivery time. 


**Examples**

Generate a deep analysis of scenario results with a SRE feel:
```bash
fault agent scenario-review --results results.json
```

Run fault as a MCP server:
```bash
fault agent tool
```
